# Google Kick Start 2021

## Why am I interested in Kick Start?
Google Kick Start allows me to develop my skills as a programmer and become more competent in the languages that I choose to compete in. I will be attempting the problems in a language that I feel would work best for each problem in the given timeframe with the eventual plan to revisit and complete the challenges in seperate languages to improve my critical thinking and language knowledge

### What is Google Kick Start?
Kick Start offers coders around the world the chance to develop and hone their programming skills through online-hosted competition rounds. The three-hour rounds feature a variety of algorithmic challenges, all developed by Google engineers so that you get a taste of the technical skills needed for a career at Google (the top competitors from our Kick Start rounds may be invited to interview at Google!). Our rounds are held regularly throughout the year at different times so they are easily accessible to coders everywhere. Each Kick Start Round is open to all participants, no pre-qualification needed, so you can try your hand at one or give them all a shot.

### How does Kick Start Work?
Register for Kick Start once on our website and you’ll be set up to compete in any round you’d like! When each round is open, the three-hour countdown begins and you’ll compete on our website solving algorithmic and mathematical problems. Following the round, you can check out your rankings and the round analysis. If you were a top competitor, you may be contacted by Google for a chance to interview.
